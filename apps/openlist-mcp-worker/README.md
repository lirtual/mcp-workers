# OpenList MCP Worker · Spec #309

An independent, fail-closed MCP adapter to the existing OpenList-Worker using a Cloudflare **Service Binding**. This adapter does not change the upstream deployment, drivers, mounts, UI or public route.

## Configuration

- Service Binding `OPENLIST` → Cloudflare script `openlist-tsworkers`.
- Secret `MCP_ACCESS_TOKEN` → incoming Portal credential, separate from upstream.
- Secret `OPENLIST_API_TOKEN` → upstream static admin-equivalent token (do not reuse incoming token).
- Plain variable `OPENLIST_ALLOWED_ROOTS` → JSON array of canonical non-root virtual paths, e.g. `["/Koofr/mcp-test"]`. Configure explicitly at deploy time; absence fails closed.

No public OpenList base URL, separate database, Cron, or generic HTTP proxy.

## Exposed tools

`openlist_capabilities`, `openlist_list_files`, `openlist_get_file`,
`openlist_search_files`, `openlist_read_text`, `openlist_create_folder`.

Remaining 12 candidates from the 18-tool Spec are **not registered** pending confirmed driver conflict behavior, disposable E2E, authenticated client approval, scoped share concurrency safety, or finite-lived link verification. A narrow `openlist_share_get` read-only adapter now exists for **internal tests only**: it requests one explicit share ID, validates every referenced file path against allowed roots, and returns only allowlisted non-secret metadata. It is **not** published as an MCP tool; no global share list or share mutation was added. In particular, **do not infer from a configured admin token that physical storage is confined to these roots**. Even listed tools still require production read-only verification before launch.

Folder creation first checks a complete bounded parent listing for collisions, then verifies the created directory via a separate read. This is **not an atomic no-overwrite guarantee**. Missing preflight evidence prevents dispatch; post-dispatch uncertainty is never treated as a confirmed success or retried automatically. Mutations are non-atomic. UTF-8 file reads disallow redirects, require byte-for-byte agreement with upstream file metadata size, and are bound to supported text types and a 256 KiB maximum. Search reconstructs result paths from the upstream `parent` + `name` fields, never from unverified `path` or raw provider URLs. `get_file`, `read_text` and listing responses verify that any upstream name/path identity matches the explicitly requested file or immediate child before exposing metadata or content.

## Verification

`pnpm --filter openlist-mcp-worker check` runs typecheck, Wrangler dry run, Node contract tests and real workerd/Miniflare multi-Worker isolation tests. The Miniflare dependency is pinned and uses the compatibility adapter for its worker options. Real binding, portal discovery and disposable live tests are separate blocking gates. **No production deployment or automatic release is authorized by this code.**

## Required read-only verification on a separately authorized production release

A separately authorized first release uses the existing manual Workflow
`bootstrap` route when `openlist-mcp-worker` is absent. Before staging or
publishing, OpenList-only read-only Cloudflare inventory checks require the
**existing** `openlist-tsworkers` Service Binding target to be deployed.
Missing or incomplete upstream inventory stops the release; no new upstream
Worker is created, and no test changes any production resource.

The existing release-time `OPENLIST_ALLOWED_ROOTS` validation reuses the
Worker runtime canonical path parser, including Unicode normalization, reserved
segments and segment-length rules; invalid roots fail before Wrangler deploy.

The existing single-Worker manual release runs `scripts/openlist-production-read-smoke.mjs`
**after** Cloudflare version/Service Binding readback and anonymous MCP denial, but
**before** registering OpenList in One-MCP. It invokes only
`openlist_list_files` with a page size of one against **each configured**
allowed root through the actual authenticated MCP endpoint. It also requires
one out-of-scope path to return an explicit `OUT_OF_SCOPE` denial. A missing/invalid
upstream token, unusable Service Binding, inaccessible root, malformed or
unsuccessful MCP result blocks Portal registration. It does not log file
names, paths, credentials, raw responses or read file contents. It also
verifies every returned item against a safe metadata allowlist, rejecting
exposed `raw_url`, `sign`, passwords, forged paths and malformed fields. Because the
check runs after deploy, it **cannot prevent the Worker code from being
published**; it fails release acceptance and blocks Portal onboarding.
This is not a substitute for real disposable driver-write acceptance, nor
does it authorize initial deployment.

## Portal registration after an authorized first release

The existing manual selected-Worker release now defaults `openlist_portal_registration=false`. A first, separately approved publication may deploy the Worker and run read-only/scope verification **without** registering it into One-MCP. Only after the real disposable-driver E2E (including file metadata/search/text and controlled folder creation) is recorded and explicitly accepted may a **separate manual** release set `openlist_portal_registration=true`. This flag is an operator approval, not proof supplied by CI; do not set it on the first publication before actual E2E evidence. Registration still follows exact Cloudflare version/binding readback, public health, anonymous rejection and production read-only checks; it validates the six-tool `tools/list` inventory and preserves all existing Portal mappings. The added input neither authorizes deployment by itself nor enables automatic releases.

## Failure state and controlled recovery

A manual release is **not atomic across Cloudflare Worker deployment and One-MCP
Portal registration**. GitHub Actions marks a failed post-deploy verification
as **failed**, but the newly published Worker may still be running. Do not
describe this as a successful launch or assume automatic rollback. In
particular:

- If version, binding, health, anonymous-denial or authenticated read/scope/
  metadata verification fails, **Portal registration has not yet started** in
  that run. Keep this incident blocked and inspect the active Worker version,
  binding, logs and approved configuration through read-only access.
- If Portal registration itself fails, it may already have created an
  unattached `openlist` server or updated Portal mappings before its final
  readback. Inspect both server inventory and the `one-mcp` mapping. Do not
  assume the server was removed, retry blindly or delete existing mappings.
- After correcting the specific failure, require a fresh, explicit authorized
  manual selected-Worker release from trusted `main`. Repeat all post-deploy
  checks; a previous partial release and green CI are not production
  acceptance. Never auto-roll back, auto-enable candidate tools or enable
  automatic publishing to recover.
